#Description -  This program will accept a plate request from the user
#and tell the user if the plate does or does not violate the rules below,
#and which rule (just the first one if more than one) the request violates.
#All characters must be letters or numbers (eg no spaces or punctuation marks)
#Minimum of 2 characters.
#Maximum of 6 characters.
#Must begin with two letters. 
#Cannot have letters and numbers intermixed (eg â€œMG53TD")
#Numbers must come at the end.
#First number cannot be 0 (zero).
